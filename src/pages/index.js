          <p>
            I started coding when I was 25. Writing basic macros in VBA led to
            my neverending curiosity about software development. I went through
            languages like Basic, C/C++ (and Assembly language), Java, PHP and
            lastly JavaScript / Typescript. It is sad üòî that I don't have
            access to my old codes although the code would not be good. I built
            my own Excel (with very limited funcitonality), program which was in
            shape of a heart ‚ù§Ô∏è , "virus" which deleted everything from desktop
            or utility which allowed user to have virtual desktops on old
            Windows.
